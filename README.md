**Are the digits of *π* random?**

>"*Pi is an infinite, non-repeating decimal – meaning that every possible number combination exists somewhere in pi. Converted in to ASCII text, somewhere in that infinite string of digits is the name of every person you will ever love , the date, time, and manner of your death, and the answers to all the great questions of the universe.<br><br>Converted in to a bitmap, somewhere in that infinite string of digits is a pixel-perfect representation of the first thing you saw on this earth, the last thing you will see before your life leaves you, and all the moments, momentous and mundane, that will occur between these two points. <br><br>All information that has ever existed or will ever exist, the DNA of every being in the universe. Everything: all contained in the ratio of a circumference and a diameter.*"
