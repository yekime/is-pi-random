## **Are the digits of pi random?**

>"*Pi is an infinite, non-repeating decimal – meaning that every possible number combination exists somewhere in pi.

#### Beautiful, poetic, and unsubstantiated.
Pi is indeed an infinite, non-repeating decimal, but so are the following:
- 0.1234567891011121314...
- 0.1010010001000010000...
- 0.1223334444555556666...

None of these are random, and you most definitely are not going to find the next winning lottery number in any of these sequences.
